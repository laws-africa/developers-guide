# Module 2: Enrichments and interactivity

In Module 1, we created a Django app to fetch, list and show works and expressions from the Laws.Africa Content API.

In Module 2, we will enrich legislation documents using Javascript and supporting data and add advanced interactivity to the app.

You can see the complete Django app in GitHub at [https://github.com/laws-africa/legislation-reader](https://github.com/laws-africa/legislation-reader).
