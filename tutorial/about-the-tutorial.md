# About the tutorial

This tutorial guides you through building a small Django application that lets a user read and interact with legislation loaded from the Laws.Africa Content API.

The functionality includes:

* Fetching and storing legislation from the Laws.Africa Content API
* Listing legislation
* A legislation detail page with a Table of Contents and well-styled text
* Interactivity and enrichments using the Laws.Africa Law Widgets

The tutorial is divided into three modules:

1. [Module 1](module-1-build-a-legislation-reader/): building a the app basics; data modelling; fetching and storing data; listing legislation; reading and styling legislation
2. [Module 2](module-2-enrichments-and-interactivity/): basic and advanced enrichments and interactivity
3. [Module 3](module-3-text-extraction-for-search-and-analysis/): extracting text from Akoma Ntoso XML for full-text search and machine learning
