# Module 1: Build a legislation reader

In this module we'll cover the following:

* Setting up the basic Django app
* Database models
* Working with the Laws.Africa Content API
* Listing works
* Displaying the content of a document
* Basic interactivity

We'll be following the [Django tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/intro/tutorial01/) for setting up an app, but we'll build a legislation reader.

At the end of the module, you should have a working legislation reader app with a legislation listing page and detail pages for each piece of legislation.

We will use:

* Django – for storing and displaying the data
* Python – for extracting data from the API
* Law widgets – a library for styling and working with interactive elements on the page

The complete working code is available in GitHub at [https://github.com/laws-africa/legislation-reader](https://github.com/laws-africa/legislation-reader).
